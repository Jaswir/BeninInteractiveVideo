1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Although the future is a little bit frightening

2
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Little bit frightening

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,000
But the life that you're riding

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Life that you're riding

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You're an iron in the rough

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A brilliant ball of clay

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can be a work of art

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,500
Ha!

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,000
If you just go all the way

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Look out!

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,500
Now what would it take to break?

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,000
See!

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I believe that you can bend

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Not only do you have to fight

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,500
Huh!

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,000
But you have got to win

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Everybody has come from fighting

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Huh!

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,000
Ha!

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Lightning!

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Although the future is a little bit frightening

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Little bit frightening

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But the life that you're riding

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Life that you're riding

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You're a natural

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Why is it so hard to see?

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Maybe it's just because

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You keep on living in me

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,500
Huh!

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
The journey's not my only one

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,500
So much more than we know

33
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,000
Huh!

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But sometimes you've got to go

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Go on and be your own hero

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,500
Everybody has come from fighting

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Come from fighting

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,000
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,500
Huh!

40
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Ha!

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Although the future is a little bit frightening

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Little bit frightening

43
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
But the life that you're riding

44
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Life that you're riding

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
You're an iron in the rough

46
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,000
Huh!

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A brilliant ball of clay

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You can be a work of art

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,500
Oh!

50
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,000
You can just go all the way

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now what would it take to break?

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,500
Huh!

53
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
I believe that you can bend

54
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Not only do you have to fight

55
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,000
Huh!

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,500
But you have got to win

57
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
Because everybody has come from fighting

58
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Come from fighting

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lightning!

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Although the future is a little bit frightening

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Little bit frightening

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But the life that you're riding

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Lightning!
